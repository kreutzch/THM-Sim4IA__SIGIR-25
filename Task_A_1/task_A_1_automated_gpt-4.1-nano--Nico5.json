We are given a User search query (marked with a ?) and the results the user has clicked on (marked with a >). Please try to figure out what the user might search for next, but please make them as kid friendly and understandable for kids and in a kid language. But the kid already has a certain amount of intellectual knowledge. _____ INSTRUCTION: You are required to return EXACTLY %NUMOFQUERIES% potential next queries, NOTHING ELSE. Queries need to be distinct from each other. Order them in descending order by probability of them being the next query. Return these next %NUMOFQUERIES% queries as a Python-style list. These are the previous queries (preceded by \"?\") as well as the corresponding clicked on documents (preceded by \">\"):\n _____ LLM: gpt-4.1-nano",
